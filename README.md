## Installing

### IDE
You can play the game simply by cloning this repository and opening it in your IDE, if you have a JDK installed with Version 17 or above.
There is only one main method - in DesktopLauncher.java - and if everything is set correctly, it should run the project.

### JAR
In releases, you can find a .jar file. In order to use it, you must have a JDK with Version 17 or above.
Both double-clicking on the file and command-line execution will work; the latter can be done using:
```console
java -jar SpaceTravel.jar
```
**Note:** executing the .jar will generate a Data folder in the same directory, which is needed to save your files.
